- Wherever an algorithm or action can be simplified, it has been
- Every possible argument value either works or produces a helpful panic
- Every group of related statements are preceded by comments (if not easily describable then that area of code needs to be reorganized or rewritten to be more clear)
- Structs are used in place of primitive number types where possible (e.g. a SpriteReference holding an index into a sprite vector rather than the index itself)
- Loops are substituted with a map or similar operation on an iterator, if possible
- Every debug/sanity check is locked behind a condition checking if DEBUG is true, if possible
- No variable or parameter is mutable longer than necessary
- No unsafe block is open longer than necessary
